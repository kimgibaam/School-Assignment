# Break brick!!!
- Server and client-based programs
- Start the game when the client connects
- When the game is over, output the total amount of time taken
- Whether to continue when the game is over

## Play a game
- Start the game with the Space key
- When a ball hits a brick, erase the brick
- Bumping on the side or top is invalid
- I'll only admit to hitting the bottom
- Game over when all the bricks are cleared
