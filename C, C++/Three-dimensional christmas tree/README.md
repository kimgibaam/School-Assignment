# Let's make Christmas trees and snow in a three-dimensional space
- Set specific coordinates through the Upper, Lower, Left, and Right keys
- Create a tree when coordinates are specified
- The size of the tree is 2 to 4 random
- Composition of the tree: Character tree, Shape tree (composition of triangle, square, or circle, etc.) and Special Symbol tree
- Complex configuration, not single sign
- Outputs front and top sides (over the sky)
- After completing the tree, press the left and right keys to turn the front only left and right (the top must be fixed)
- Enter space or enter key after tree completion
- Snow fall
- Snowing for a set time
- Stop when the set time expires
- Pressing the left and right keys after the timeout turns the front only left and right (the top must be fixed)
