### Function: Create, Insert, Reverse, Delete, and Display

- Create function: rational generation with zero length and NULL head
- Insert function: 
The input order of one node is not in order of size
2 -6 14 9 14 7 9 â€“1 -3 -1 27 4 -1 3 2 10 1 5 10 0
The last input is when the denominator is zero
However, if the same number of glass values are entered, a node with that value is also added
Keep a simple link list to make it ascending

- Delete function: 
1 or more digits may be entered (e.g. 0.7 3 2 4)
If elements of the maximum minimum value range exist, the node is deleted and the number is output
Otherwise, it says no

- Reverse function: 
simple link list changed to reverse order and saved in new rational
The original list of connections must remain the same

- Display function: Connection list should be printed in numerator/denominator form from head to end
