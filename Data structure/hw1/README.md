# Program the algorithm to find the number of cases and the contents of each case with C

### Input : Any natural number n

### Condition: The person climbing the stairs hurt his right foot, so the following restrictions exist
- Left foot can climb up to one, two and three stairs at a time
- Right foot can only climb up to 0 and 1 stair at a time
- Unable to use the same foot in a row

### Output: Number of cases and order of number of windows
- If n is 2,
- 2 (left),

1 (left), 1 (right),
1 (left), 0 (oh), 1 (left),
1 (oh), 1 (left),
0 (oh), 2 (left),
0 (oh), 1 (left), 1 (oh),
0 (oh), 1 (left), 0 (oh), 1 (left),

- a total of seven cases

### Action Time Comparison Graph (Units: Seconds)
