### Write a program C that performs the following functions for the binary search tree.

### Function: Insert, Delete, Find Max, Level Sum, Children, Inder Search, and Preorder Traverse.

- Insert function: Multiple fractions entered. Last one is zero denominator.
2 -6 14 9 14 7 9 â€“1 -3 -1 27 4 -1 3 2 10 1 5 10 0
However, even if the same value is entered, it is added to the binary search tree.

- Delete function: 1 number entered.
Find the node with that value. Outputs nonexistent (0).
Deletes nodes from the binary search tree and outputs the number of deleted nodes.

- Find Max function: Outputs the largest value from the binary search tree.

- Level sum function: 1 level value entered.
Outputs by adding data values from all nodes at that level.

- Children function: 1 number entered (between 0 and 2).
Outputs the number of nodes with the corresponding number of children.

- Inorder Search function: 1 digit entered between 1 and the tree size.
When visiting the binary search tree in the Inorder Traverse method, the fraction located kth is displayed.

- Preorder Traverse function: Visits the binary search tree in a Preorder Traverse method and outputs the fractions of the nodes in order.
