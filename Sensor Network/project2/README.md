# Zigbee Communications Exercise !

- Program Description !!

- B acquires data through temperature, humidity, and ultraviolet sensors
- Each data transmits the difference between the sensing value and the mean value after the measurement to A
- B expresses the difference between the sensing value and the given reference value in lead
- Based on the value received wirelessly, A obtains the sensing value of B and displays it on the LCD
- The value obtained through A's sensor is also displayed on the LCD
- The difference between the sensing value of B and the sensing value of A is expressed as the speed at which the LED flashes
